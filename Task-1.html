    <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Labeled data training (e.g., regression, classification).</li>
      <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Pattern discovery in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering).</li>
      <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Learning via rewards and penalties.</li>

    <h2>Key Algorithms</h2>
    <div>
      <div ><p>In Machine Learning (ML), algorithms are mathematical procedures that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming. They are used to identify patterns, make predictions, and automate tasks by analyzing data and learning from it. These algorithms can be categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques. </p>
    </div>

      <div ><h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
        <p>Uses labeled data to train models, enabling them to predict outcomes or classify data points. Examples include regression (predicting numerical values) and classification (categorizing data). </p>
     </div>
     
      <div ><h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
        <p>Analyzes unlabeled data to discover patterns, clusters, or anomalies. Examples include clustering (grouping similar data points) and dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of variables while preserving important information)</p>
    </div>
      <div ><h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3> 
    <p>Trains agents to make decisions in an environment to maximize rewards over time.</p>
    </div>
      <div><h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
        <p>Involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for model training. This includes handling missing values, outliers, and scaling data to improve model performance. </p>
    </div>
